# Big Data -> Big Ding Dong (Safari)

The phrase big data has been twisted, warped, and coaxed into meaning almost anything. What's one more loaded meaning?

This Safari extension replaces occurrences of 'big data' on web pages with 'big ding dong'.

Derived from Logan Collins' [cloud-to-butt-safari](https://github.com/logancollins/cloud-to-butt-safari) Safari extension, which is derived from Steven Frank's [cloud-to-butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt) Chrome extension.
